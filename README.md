A classification study on Mental Health and the Workplace
by Lidet Alemu and Charles Pryor

This is a classification study on employees on Mental Health in the Technology Industry.  The classification output is binary with either "Yes" or "No" in regards to whether an employee's mental health problems interfere with their workplace performance.  

We took data from Kaggle that was formed from roughly 1500 questionnaires.  The questionnaires encompassed all demographics and asked questions regarding workplace response to mental health and employees.

After much data analysis, our metrics showed that Random Forest was the best classification model to perform this analysis.  We ended up with a score of 80 for our model which gave validity to our study.

Lidet found the data set.  Charles and Lidet cleaned the dataset and performed various tests.  They both then formed the powerpoint.  All are attached to this repository.
